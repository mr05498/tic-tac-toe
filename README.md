# tic-tac-toe

Our game, tic tac toe is basically a two player game in which a 3 x 3 grid is used, and on each turn a player has to place their designated mark in the said grid. The game will start by asking the name of the two players, after that the two players will be asked about the marks of their choice. The player who currently has their turn will then be asked the position where they want to put in the mark. The game will continue until any one of the players succeeds in placing three same marks in a row, column or diagonally or the game draws. After the game will finish, a scoreboard will appear, showing the number of matches each player has won. After each match, the players will be asked if they want to play another match or quit the game. We have added the feature that the first turn in each match will be alternate to avoid bias and provide equal oppportunity to both players.
